CBAvail
=======
The CBAvail callback is used to react to recieved service available 
request events.

Action
------
The callback will create a service available response event 
for the requested event. The event is added directly to the 
events to be sent to the currently used package.

The created availability response event is set up to contain the 
service identifiers mentioned in :doc:`../../Service_Info/Service_Info`. 
The result of the availability response event is negative if the 
used password file does not exist.
